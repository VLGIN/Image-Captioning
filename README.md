Novel model for image captioning, which was pretrained on several datasets with modern hardware.
In this project, I finetune on pretrained Vinvl for evaluation purpose.

# Show, Attend and Tell
[paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/xuc15.html)

An architecture that bring attention for cross-model task.
In this project, I built model from scratch and made comparison in term of performance with result from OSCAR++.

# Organizing
1. OSCAR: fork from https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar for finetuning.
2. Show, attend and tell: build from scratch.
3. Result_report: images for training procedure.
4. Project3.pdf: report for the process of researching, installing and testing. This document is in Vietnamese.
